## Student Performance
### This project was on predicting what affects students performance in their final examination score.

### In this prediction all the collected informaton were considered to know what affected about 6000 students performance in this examination. 

### To start this I got my data from Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/student-performance-factors](url), I started by cleaining the dataset using R. I removed the rows with null values and checked to be sure it was empty(more details on this in the code).
### First of all I made a graph to check where the majority of the range of scores were by ploting a density graph. This showed were the scores of most students fell. Below is a picture.
